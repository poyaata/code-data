# code-data
data &amp; code for simulation and fmri analysis
the leadfield matrix is 64x15003. 64 is the number of EEG electrodes (channel 32 belongs to ECG, and therefore the 32th row of this matrix is all NaN. 
the fmri codes consist of the code for some of our GLM analyses as well as those for computing cluster-correction threshold.
